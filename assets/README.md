```markdown
This folder contains static assets used by the portfolio site.

Guidelines
- Place personal images (headshot) at `assets/photo.jpg` or update `index.html` to reference a different filename.
- SVG icons and badges can be stored as `assets/*.svg`.
- Add `resume.pdf` if you want a downloadable resume; reference it from `index.html` or other pages.

Backups
- A `backups/` folder exists at the repository root for archived image sets; do not store working images only in backups.

Favicon
- The repository contains a generated favicon; use `scripts/make_favicon.py` to regenerate if needed.

Notes
- Keep filenames stable (do not include timestamps in referenced filenames) so `index.html` can reference static paths.
