# Add Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
Labels: security,medium
Severity: Medium

Description:
There is no GitHub Actions workflow that automatically scans npm dependencies for vulnerabilities. Regular automated scans help detect known vulnerabilities early.

Remediation:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/security.yml`) to run `npm audit` and optionally `npm outdated` on push/pull_request/schedule.
- Consider adding Dependabot or Snyk for continuous monitoring.
